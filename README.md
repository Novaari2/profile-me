## Tech Stack

- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) - Vue.js Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - Progressive JavaScript Framework

## Development

The project follows Nuxt 3's conventions for routing and component organization:

- Pages are automatically routed based on their file names in the `pages/` directory
- Components in the `components/` directory are auto-imported
- The default layout in `layouts/default.vue` provides the navigation and footer structure
- Theme switching is handled by the `ThemeToggle` component using Tailwind's dark mode
